# SQL_2_Sales_Analysis
#### This project performs a detailed analysis of the Superstore dataset using SQL queries. It investigates total sales across various categories and sub-categories, top-performing products, customer segments, and geographical sales breakdowns by city, state, and region. Date conversion techniques are applied to transform the date format for monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales trends. The analysis also includes customer behavior, such as average order size, top customers, and order frequency. Shipping modes, shipping times, and processing times from order to ship date are evaluated to understand operational efficiencies and product performance over time.
